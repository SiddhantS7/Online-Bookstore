# Online-Bookstore
To create an online bookstore using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C, you'd build a digital platform where users can browse, search for, and buy books. Key components and features include data structures like arrays or linked lists to store book and user data, algorithms for searching, sorting, and recommendations, user interfaces for registration, book listings, and shopping carts, security measures, performance optimization, scalability, payment integration, an admin dashboard, user reviews, and notifications. This project requires strong DSA knowledge, web development skills, and security considerations. Libraries like Libcurl and SQLite can be useful tools.
